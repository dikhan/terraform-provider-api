## Reporting Issues

Issues reported are more than welcome as they help us understand what's broken, what features are missing or even ways to
enhance the product. In order to keep the process of reporting an issue organised we encourage contributors to follow the steps below:

1. Double check the [list of issues](https://github.com/dikhan/terraform-provider-api/issues) already opened and
if the issue is not reported feel free to create a [New Issue](https://github.com/dikhan/terraform-provider-openapi/issues)
2. Providing enough context and details about the issue is critical for people to understand the problem. Hence, the following
issue templates are available to help filling out the blanks. 
  - [Bug Report](https://github.com/dikhan/terraform-provider-openapi/issues/new?template=bug_report.md)
  - [Feature Request](https://github.com/dikhan/terraform-provider-openapi/issues/new?template=feature_request.md)    

## Pull Request Submission

Pull requests are appreciated, please follow the steps below when creating a new pull request:

- Create an issue that describes the problem being solved if not already created.
- Create a pull request and link to the related issue. For more information on creating a pull request, please see the [Github Pull Request docs](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).
  - The title of the PR should follow the below convention. Pick the appropriate option for the type of change. This 
  is important because the release notes will include this information.
    - Feature Request: `[FeatureRequest: Issue #X] <PR Title>`
    - Bug Fixes: `[BugFix: Issue #X] <PR Title>`
    - Tech Debt: `[TechDebt: Issue #X] <PR Title>` 
    - New Release: `[NewRelease] vX.Y.Z`
  - A [pull request template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) is provided to help populating the PR. Please provide a clear 
description about the change requested.

## Contributing Code 

The best way to contribute to this repository is by creating a [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)
and follow the below: 

- Create a feature branch prefixed with the type of change (bugfix/feature):
    - Bug fix: `git checkout -b **bugfix**/my-bug-fix`
    - Feature requests: `git checkout -b **feature**/my-new-feature`
- Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
- Execute ```make test-all``` from the terraform_provider_api directory and make sure the exit code is clean. This will
make sure that the Pull Request will have a clean build. The [test-all target](https://github.com/dikhan/terraform-provider-openapi/blob/master/Makefile)
in the Makefile will run gofmt, govet, golint and then it will run the unit and integration tests.
- Push to the branch: `git push origin <branch-name>`
- Submit a pull request following the [Pull request guidelines](#pull-request-submissio)

### Committing Code

Commits are very important to understand the history of the repo changes and also if done well greatly help the reviewing 
process. We are committed to keep the repository code organised and therefore expect contributors to follow some
best practises as enlisted below:

- Commit related messages: A commit should contain related changes.
- Commit often: Small commits make it easier for other developers to understand the changes and also make it easier to
roll back the changes if needed.
- Write good commit messages: What is good? Imagine you did not know anything about the change and had to learn more about 
it by reading the commit message - then write the commit message.

### Testing
Changes should be accompanied by relevant tests that prove the bug fix is effective or that a feature works.

Tests should follow the format detailed in the [Testing](TESTING.md) doc.

### Coding Standards

The terraform provider OpenAPI uses the following coding standards to make sure the code is maintained clean, secure and organised.

- [gofmt](https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/) formats the source code. The following target in the [Makefile](https://github.com/dikhan/terraform-provider-openapi/blob/master/Makefile) runs go format.
```
$ make fmt
```
- [govet](https://golang.org/cmd/vet/) is a simplified dead code detector. The following target in the [Makefile](https://github.com/dikhan/terraform-provider-openapi/blob/master/Makefile) runs go vet.
```
$ make vet
```
- [golint](https://github.com/golang/lint) detects style mistakes. The following target in the [Makefile](https://github.com/dikhan/terraform-provider-openapi/blob/master/Makefile) runs go lint.
 ```
 $ make lint
 ```

- [Gosec](https://github.com/securego/gosec) inspects source code for security problems. The following target in the [Makefile](https://github.com/dikhan/terraform-provider-openapi/blob/master/Makefile) runs go sec.
 ```
 $ make gosec
 ```

- Follow the go coding standards as outlined in [Effective go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html)

### Documentation

This repository aims to translate the latest Swagger OpenApi spec with the corresponding configuration in latest
versions of Terraform. These two products are constantly evolving and adding support for new features and therefore
keeping the docs updated is paramount. Any contributor should keep in mind this and update the [How to](../docs/how_to.md) 
accordingly based on new features added or updated.
